# sam-java
Meta's [Segment Anything (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) model, ported to Java SE 17.

Eventual goal is to move this into a [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) [plugin](https://github.com/JOSM/josm-plugins) for segmentation of aerial imagery for OpenStreetMap. Further versions from that will be finetuned on aerial imagery for better results.
